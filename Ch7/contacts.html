<h2>Facebook</h2>
<p>I don't get on social media as much as i use to. Only time i use Facebook is to see whats going on locally, catchup with family and friends, and watch entertaing videos. Feel free to message me on Facebook anytime, especially If you cant reach me on through my email or cell. This wont be the best way to get in contact with me, but i will get the message eventually. The link i've provided below will lead you to my page.<br>

<h2>Instagram</h2>
<p>Instagram is a popular social media platform, primarily focused on photo and video sharing, allowing users to connect with friends and followers. Users can upload, edit, and share media, as well as view, like, and comment on posts from others. The platform offers features like filters, hashtags, and geographical tagging to enhance content. Instagram has evolved from a photo-sharing app into a major business tool used for marketing and connecting with customers. My insta link is below. I plan on posting my eductaional journey, Fatherhood, and repost of videos i find funny. <br>

<h2>Personal Cell</h2>
<p>My iphone 12 broke last month so i upgraded to the iPhone 16. I love how the features are more refined as a whole. for example, the dual-lens array on the back, with a 48 megapixel Fusion wide-angle lens and 12 megapixel ultra-wide lens. The cameras are now aligned vertically for the first time since the iPhone 12, instead of diagonally like on the iPhone 15, enabling spatial video capture. But enough about the iphone. if you wish to contact me through my cell phone or email. Both links are below. <br>
