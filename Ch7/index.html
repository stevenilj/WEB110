<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hey, i'm Steven. I stumbled upon a degree in computer science in an effort to provide a better lifestyle for my 
daughter and I. The dream is to one day be able to work remotely, while making enough money to travel, have fun, and work at the same time. Even if that doesn't come true fully. I’ll still be happy to be working in a field in which I love. Like many people, I'm sure, the pay for these types of careers is what sparked our interest initially. But for me, it's more than money. In fact, the more I research the arts, sciences, history, and future of computers… the more i want to be a part of it all. 

</p>
<h2>Why I Chose CS</h2>
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li>To expand my knowledge of computers</li>
    <li>To be a part of history, while making life better for others through computers</li>
    <li>The potential lifestyle it could provide my daughter</li>
  </ul> <br> <br>

<h2>Plans After JCCC</h2>
<p>After graduating from JCCC, I plan on furthering my education at UMKC. At UMKC I’ll be earning a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I've been told by many that graduates have a wide range of career options to explore. These include traditional roles like software developer, web developer, and systems analyst, as well as emerging fields like data science, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is what I want to concentrate my studies on. Who knows, maybe after obtaining these degree’s, i may decide to further my education even more, with a Master's degree.
