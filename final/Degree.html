                <h2>Curriculum & Length</h2>
                <p>During a four-year bachelor's degree in computer science, students take 
                general education credits in English, math, science, business, and history, 
                plus computer science courses. Some employers prefer professionals to have 
                a broad general education and degree to demonstrate proficiency.

                <h2>Is a Degree in Computer Science Still Worth it?</h2>
                <p>Yes, a computer science degree is generally still worth it in 2025, particularly 
                    for those seeking structured learning, networking opportunities, and a strong 
                    foundation for careers in the tech industry. While self-teaching and bootcamps 
                    can be alternative paths, a CS degree offers a comprehensive curriculum and the 
                    credibility that many employers value, especially for specialized roles or work visas.
