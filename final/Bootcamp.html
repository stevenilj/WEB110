                <h2>What is Coding Bootcamp?</h2>
                <p>A coding bootcamp is an intensive, accelerated learning program that teaches 
                    in-demand technical skills, primarily focused on software development, to help 
                    individuals transition into or advance in tech careers. They offer a more focused and often
                    faster alternative to traditional computer science degrees, emphasizing practical skills 
                    and project-based learning.

                <p>While a college degree can be beneficial, it's not a requirement for a 
                    successful tech career. Coding bootcamps provide a pathway to a rewarding 
                    career by focusing on practical skills, portfolio building, and job placement assistance.

                <h2>Networking</h2>
                <p>Coding bootcamp networking involves building connections with people in the tech industry,
                    including fellow students, instructors, and professionals. This can be done through various 
                    channels, such as online communities, meetups, and professional networking events.
                    Effective networking can provide support, mentorship, and potential job opportunities.

                <h2>Top 5 Reasons to Choose Bootcamp Path</h2>
                
                <h3>Focused, Job-Ready Skills:</h3>
                <p>Coding bootcamps deliver an intensive curriculum centered around in-demand skills and 
                    programming languages directly applicable to current industry needs.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Accelerated Learning and Faster Entry to the Workforce</h3>
                <p>Bootcamps offer a rapid pathway to a tech career, typically lasting several weeks or 
                    months, compared to the years required for a traditional degree. This accelerated learning 
                    allows graduates to enter the job market and start earning a salary sooner, potentially within 
                    a year or less.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Affordability and Accessibility</h3>
                <p>Generally, coding bootcamps are less expensive than a four-year degree, with average costs significantly 
                    lower than university tuition. Many bootcamps also offer flexible payment options like scholarships, payment 
                    plans, or income-share agreements, making them more accessible to a wider range of individuals.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Strong Career Support and Networking</h3>
                <p>Bootcamps provide comprehensive career services, including resume workshops, mock interviews, and job placement assistance.
                    They often have strong industry connections and partnerships, which can facilitate internships, job placements, and valuable 
                    networking opportunities within the tech community.
                </p>
                
                <h3>High Return on Investment</h3>
                <p>Bootcamp graduates often experience a significant increase in their earning potential after completing the program.
                    The combination of lower costs and the potential for a quicker salary increase makes coding bootcamps an attractive investment for many aspiring tech professionals.
                </p>
                <p>*Coding bootcamp has its appealing advantages for sure. However if you plan on moving up to higher positions a degree is usually required. In my opinion if you're serious about your career I would recommend both. What that looks like is obtaining your degree, sharpening your skill through bootcamp, and mastering your craft through job experiences.</p>
