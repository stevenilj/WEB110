                <h2>How To Decide Between Getting a Degree in Computer Science or Attending a Coding Bootcamp?</h2>
                <p>A degree in computer science and a coding bootcamp offer distinct paths to a tech career. Computer science degrees provide a broad, theoretical foundation, while coding bootcamps focus on practical, job-ready skills. Bootcamps can be a faster and more affordable option for career changers, while a degree offers more long-term career flexibility and academic depth.</p>
                <h2>What Employers Have To Say?</h2>
                <p>Employers generally view both computer science degrees and coding bootcamp graduates favorably, but with different considerations. While a computer science degree, as previously stated, is often seen as providing a stronger theoretical foundation and broader skillset, coding bootcamps are recognized for delivering practical, up-to-date skills relevant to specific job roles. Many employers now recognize that both paths can lead to successful careers in tech, with a growing number hiring graduates from both.</p>
