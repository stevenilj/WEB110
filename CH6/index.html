    <h2>Planets</h2>
    <p>Planets are celestial bodies that orbit stars, like our Sun.  The word "planet" originates from the ancient Greek word "planēt," meaning "wanderer," referring to their observed movement across the sky.  In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) established a definition of a planet, requiring it to orbit a star, be massive enough for its gravity to pull it into a round shape, and clear its orbit of other similar-sized objects. Our solar system consists of eight planets, including terrestrial planets like Earth and Mars, and gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn.

    <h2>Stars</h2>
    <p>Stars are massive, luminous spheres of plasma, held together by their own gravity and powered by nuclear fusion at their cores.  This process, where hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium, releases enormous amounts of energy that causes the star to shine.  Stars vary in size, temperature, color, and lifespan, ranging from a few million to trillions of years. Our Sun is an example of a star, and there are estimated to be hundreds of billions of stars in our Milky Way galaxy alone.

    <h2>Galaxies</h2>
    <p>Galaxies are vast systems containing stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter, all bound together by gravity.  They can range from small dwarf galaxies with a few thousand stars to giant galaxies with trillions of stars. Galaxies are classified by their visual morphology, with common types being spiral, elliptical, and irregular.  The Milky Way, our home galaxy, is a spiral galaxy containing billions of stars, including our Sun.
